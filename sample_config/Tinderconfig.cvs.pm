# By forcing us into a seperate package, we can keep ourselves out 
# of the namespace of the main script. This way, when invoking config 
# vars, it must be called like $Tinderconfig::var instead of $var;

#===========================================================
#BOXNAME
# set this to the name of the tinderbox that you wish to 
# see displayed as the col. heading on the tinderbox server. 
# This should probably contain your OS.
$boxname = ""; 
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#SERVERADDRESS
# set this to the email address that the results should be sent 
# to.
$serveraddress = 'tinder@onion.perl.org'; 
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#TINDERBOXPAGE
# set this to the page on the tinderbox (SeaMonkey, MozillaTest, 
# etc) that you wish to display this tinderboxen.
$tinderboxpage = "perl6";

#===========================================================
#ADMIN
# set this to the email address of the person who should
# get trouble reports
$admin = "";
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#CVSROOT
# set this to the cvsroot you wish to use
# note that you must have cvs logged in once with the account 
# that you will be using to power the tinderbox to get a 
# ~/.cvsroot file created.
$cvsroot = ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.perl.org:/home/perlcvs"; 
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#CVSMODULE
# set this to the module that you would like the tinderbox 
# client script to pull. If you use a script to pull, then 
# set this to the script so that it can be downloaded from 
# the server and set $prebuild so it will be run to do the 
# complete pull. The script should handle everything related to 
# pulling.
$cvsmodule = "parrot";
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#PULLDIR
# Set this var to the directory that the source will be once 
# the pull is complete. For example, if you are checking out 
# a module with the full path of mozilla/webtools/bugzilla, 
# you would enter that here. It is important that you enter 
# a correct value here, or the script will fail.
# Please ensure that you insert the value in the "" quotes 
# and not in the single quotes.
$pulldir = './'."parrot"; 
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#PREBUILD
# This var should be set to a script (if any) that you would 
# like run before the build, but after the pull. For example, 
# if you have a script which you checkout of cvs, and then run 
# to do the full pull, you would enter that here and the full 
# cvs path to the script in $CVSMODULE above. Note that this 
# script runs _in_ the cvs tree directory.

#BUILDCOMMANDS
# This array should be set to the commands needed to build. 
# The commands will be run in sequence starting with [0].
@buildcommands = ('perl Configure.pl --defaults','make test_prog');
#===========================================================

#===========================================================
#FAILURESTATES
# This should be set to a list of rexexp patterns that will 
# indicate an error building the source. Be carful with this, 
# as if the pattern matches any output with the build it will 
# show up as a failure on the tinderbox page.
@failurestates = ('\[checkout aborted\]','\: cannot find module','^C ','Stop in');

#===========================================================
#TESTS
# This hash should be set to the commands to run to perform the 
# test as the key, and an array of two regexp patterns that
# indicate a PASS of the test, and a build failure,
# in that order.  It will be considered a test failed if the
# none of the regexps match.  If the second regexp is blank,
# the failure of this test will not be able to result in a
# burning tree on tinderbox.  Having anything in the build
# error regexp at all is mostly useful for Perl programs,
# where the same compile test determines both build errors
# and test failures.
%tests = (
# 'COMMAND' => ['PASS','FAILURE'],
'make test' => ['All tests successful',''],
);
#===========================================================


#===========================================================
#POSTBUILD
# This array should be set to commands (if any) that should 
# be run after the build. For example, if you would like to 
# upload the build to an ftp site, you can set this to a 
# packaging script and/or a shell script to do the upload.
@postbuild = ();

#===========================================================
#MINCYCLETIME
# This should be set to the minimum time between tinderbox
# test cycles.  This is to avoid overloading the server
# with lots of closely-spaced emails.  If the build and
# test process takes longer than this amount of time, the
# build and test process will restart immediately, however
# if it takes less, it will wait until this time has
# expired before restarting.
